  "text": "Date is July 5th. Client identifier is NJ. Client presented with his mother and sister in session. Mother reported 14 consecutive days being free of a bowel accident. She attributed this at least partially to a conversation with the primary care physician that occurred in front of client. This is consistent with clients rapid progress after one meeting with therapist last year. During session client showed the ability to accept therapist praise and mother's praise for progress in preventing bowel movements in his pants. Additionally of significant note, client said that he had to go to the bathroom in session and then indicated that he was able to hold it. He was also able to appeal to mother to assist him with going to the bathroom after he determined that he could not. This appears to be significant progress from whatever avoidance was preventing him from using the toilet appropriately. Spoke with mother regarding referral to GI specialist made by PCP. Plan is for mother to hold off on all pending appointments including with this therapist until it is clear if client needs further intervention. Mother was given this therapist scheduling link and directed to schedule appointments as needed if a regression should occur. This decision is based partly on clients progress after last treatment episode. End of note."
